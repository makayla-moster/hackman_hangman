# Hackman Challenge

This website was produced for the Clemson Computer Science Discord's Hackman Challenge during February 2022. The challenge was to create a hangman game utilizing the [hackman_api](https://github.com/Jay-Madden/hackmanapi).

For this challenge, I first tried to use React/HTML/CSS as my framework, but was unable to incorporate the API for reasons unknown to me. However, for my second try I chose to use vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS. I used [this repository](https://github.com/jelofsson/hangman-js) as my base and then built Pirate Hangman from there by designing my own assets in ProCreate and incorporating my own styling and JS functions as well as the required api calls.
